## Class-based Components in React

- Up until the introduction of hooks in Feb 2019, React applications were built using Class-based components

## Lifecycle Methods 
 
- Class-based components introduced the concept of component lifecycle methods, allowing developers to hook into specific phases of a component's lifecycle. 

- These methods, such as the following provided developers with fine-grained control over component initialization, updating, and cleanup.

  - `componentDidMount`
  - `componentDidUpdate` 
  - `componentWillUnmount`
